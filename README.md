# 📊 React + TypeScript Data Table with Sorting, Filtering, Search & Pagination

A **pure frontend React + TypeScript** project that displays tabular data with sorting, filtering, searching, pagination, and inline status updates.  
All data is stored locally in a `data.ts` file — no backend required.

- **TypeScript**
- **React Hooks**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Local Data Source** (`data.ts` file)

## 🧠 How It Works
- Data Source: All data is stored in src/data.ts as a TypeScript array of objects
- Sorting: Clicking on column headers toggles ascending/descending sort order
- Filtering: Dropdown menus let you filter rows by multiple criteria
- Search: The search bar filters rows in real time
- Pagination: Displays limited rows per page with navigation buttons
- Status Update: Clicking the action button allows you to change the status field

## 📌 Notes
- This is frontend only — no API or database is connected
- Changes to the table (like status updates) are not persisted after refresh
- For persistence, you can integrate with localStorage or a backend API
